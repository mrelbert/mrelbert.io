Last night, I had a thought: "What if breaking my ankle was the best thing to ever happen for me?" My wedding is in a month, and I've been going through a rollercoaster of emotions. But after accepting the situation and embracing Eckhart's advice to "resist nothing," I found some emotional footing.

I know this question may sound overly optimistic or delusional, but I'm in charge of my attitude. If I'm a co-author of my life's narrative, then I want to contribute a tone worthy of a hero's journey. So I asked myself, what if this setback is an opportunity to feel gratitude?

I am grateful for my ability to breathe, touch, taste, see, and speak. I am grateful for my capacity to think, smile, and listen. And I'm also grateful to know that my suffering could be much worse. In fact, I'm already planning to volunteer to help others in physical need once I'm healed.

But what if there's more to this experience than just gratitude? What if breaking my ankle is the catalyst for a spiritual revival? I vow to never forget this lesson and to appreciate the ability to walk, which is never guaranteed.

Maybe this all sounds like self-pep talk, but I prefer it to feeling sorry, bitter, and resentful. Ultimately, the answer to whether this is the best thing to ever happen to me depends on whether I value my health as much as I do now. And as the saying goes, gratitude is the best attitude.
